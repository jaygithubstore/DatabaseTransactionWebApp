# DatabaseTransactionWebApp
Web application that simulates the ordering of food from many company branches. Database was created from scratch by Jay and Jacob and is normalized up to BCNF. This web app allows you to commit a single order or simulate 100+ serialized concurrent orders at the click of a button.
